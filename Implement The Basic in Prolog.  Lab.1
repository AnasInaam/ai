✅ Program 1 (Facts only)
Code (correct):
likes(ram, mango).
girl(seema).
like(bill, candy).
real(rose).
own(john, gold).

run : 

?- likes(ram, What).
?- girl(seema).
?- own(john, gold).


Explain: 

Explanation (medium length)

This program only contains facts, which describe simple relationships:

likes(ram, mango). → Ram likes mango.

girl(seema). → Seema is a girl.

like(bill, candy). → Bill likes candy.

real(rose). → Rose is real.

own(john, gold). → John owns gold.

There is no logic or rules, only stored information. When you query Prolog, it checks whether the fact exists and returns true or false, or fills variables you ask for.




✅ Program 2 (Temperature conversion)
Code (correct):
c_to_f(C, F) :- F is (C * 9 / 5) + 32.
freezing(F) :- F =< 32.


Run sample queries:

?- c_to_f(0, F).
F = 32.

?- c_to_f(25, F).
F = 77.

?- freezing(30).
true.

?- freezing(50).
false.


Explanation (medium)

This program defines two simple rules:

c_to_f(C,F) converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula
F = (C × 9/5) + 32

freezing(F) is true if the Fahrenheit temperature is 32°F or below, meaning freezing point of water.

Prolog computes numeric expressions using is, and comparisons like =< allow checking conditions.

This small program demonstrates how Prolog can perform calculations and simple logical checks.
